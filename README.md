Fuck You OS
===========

An operating system generator that gives a big Fuck You.

fuck-you-os.py will generate some assembly that:

* Boots
* Draws the contents of a .pbm
* Repeatedly rotates the screen pallette

Backstory
=========

Took my laptop in for a repair, without the harddrive of course. They said it wouldn't boot without the hard
drive. So I wrote this to it with a big "IT WORKS" image.

Thats it.
